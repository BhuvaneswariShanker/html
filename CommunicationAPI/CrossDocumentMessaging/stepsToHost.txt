1. Update the path to the Windows hosts file (C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts) and 
the Linux version (/etc/hosts) by adding two entries pointing to your localhost (IP address 
127.0.0.1), as shown in the following example: 
    127.0.0.1 chat.example.net 
    127.0.0.1 portal.example.com 
    ■ Note You must restart your browser after modifying the host file to ensure that the DNS entries take effect. 
2. Install Python, which includes the lightweight SimpleHTTPServer web server. 
3. Navigate to the directory that contains the two example files 
    (postMessageParent.html and postMessageWidget.html). 
4. Start Python as follows: 
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9999 // python 2
    python -m http.server 9999      // python 3
5. Open a browser and navigate to 
    http://portal.example.com:9999/postMessagePortal.html.
